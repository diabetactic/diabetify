## Understanding Glucose Readings

### Reading the Dashboard

The Dashboard provides both simplified and detailed views of your child's glucose management.

#### Kid-Friendly View (Default)

**Status Indicator**

- **Happy Face** (Green): Excellent! 70%+ time in range
- **Neutral Face** (Yellow): Good, 50-70% time in range
- **Needs Work Face** (Red): Less than 50% in range

**Simple Metrics**

- **Time in Good Range**: Percentage of readings within target (70-180 mg/dL)
- **Average Sugar**: Mean glucose level
- **Recent Readings**: Last 5 glucose measurements

#### Parent/Technical View

Tap "More Details" or "Parent View" to see:

**Estimated HbA1c**

- Shows average blood glucose control over 2-3 months
- Calculated from glucose readings in the app
- Target: Usually below 7% (confirm with endocrinologist)
- **Note**: This is an estimate; lab HbA1c tests are more accurate

**GMI (Glucose Management Indicator)**

- Similar to HbA1c but calculated from continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data
- Provides a comparable metric when using CGM devices

**Coefficient of Variation (CV%)**

- Measures glucose variability
- Lower is better (more stable glucose levels)
- Target: Below 36%
- High CV indicates swings between high and low glucose

**Time in Range (TIR) Breakdown**

- **Very Low**: Below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) - Target: 0%
- **Low**: 54-70 mg/dL (3.0-3.9 mmol/L) - Target: Less than 4%
- **In Range**: 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L) - Target: 70%+
- **High**: 180-250 mg/dL (10.0-13.9 mmol/L) - Target: Less than 25%
- **Very High**: Above 250 mg/dL (13.9 mmol/L) - Target: Less than 5%

### Understanding Patterns

**Review trends regularly:**

- Are certain times of day problematic?
- Do specific activities (sports, school) affect glucose?
- Are there patterns around meals or insulin doses?

**Use filters in the Readings tab:**

- Filter by date range (today, week, month)
- Filter by glucose status (low, high, normal)
- Search notes for keywords (e.g., "soccer," "pizza")

### Meal Context Tags

Encourage your child to tag readings with meal context:

- **Before/After Meals**: Helps identify post-meal spikes
- **Fasting**: Morning readings before breakfast
- **Bedtime**: Important for overnight glucose management
- **Other**: Any special circumstances

### Adding Notes

The notes field is valuable for:

- Activity: "After soccer practice," "At birthday party"
- Symptoms: "Felt shaky," "Headache," "Very thirsty"
- Food: "Pizza lunch," "Forgot snack"
- Insulin: "Missed morning dose," "Changed pump site"

These details help you and the healthcare team identify patterns and adjust treatment.

## Working with Your Healthcare Team

Diabetactic is designed to complement, not replace, your healthcare team's guidance.

### Before Appointments

**Prepare Your Data:**

1. Ensure all recent readings are synced
2. Review the Dashboard statistics
3. Note any patterns or concerns
4. Export data if requested (via Tidepool or hospital portal)

**Questions to Ask:**

- Are our target ranges appropriate?
- Is the time in range improving?
- Should we adjust insulin doses based on patterns?
- Are there specific times of day that need attention?

### Sharing Data During Appointments

**Option 1: Tidepool**
If your provider uses Tidepool, they can view data directly through the platform.

**Option 2: Hospital Portal**
Data synced to the hospital is available in their electronic health record (EHR) system.

**Option 3: App Demonstration**
Bring your phone to the appointment and show the Dashboard and Readings screens.

**Option 4: Screenshot/Print**
Take screenshots of key screens (Dashboard stats, specific readings) to share.

### Using Appointment Features

**Viewing Upcoming Appointments:**

- The Appointments tab shows scheduled visits
- Tap an appointment to see details (date, time, doctor, location)

**Requesting Appointments:**

1. Tap "Request Appointment"
2. Wait for hospital approval (status changes from "Pending" to "Accepted")
3. Fill in the appointment form:
   - Reason for visit (routine control, follow-up, consultation, etc.)
   - Current insulin regimen
   - Questions or concerns

**Appointment Reminders:**
The app sends notifications before appointments to help you prepare.

### Communication

**In-App Notes:**
Use the notes field in glucose readings to communicate observations:

- "Please review - multiple lows after school this week"
- "Question: Should we adjust breakfast insulin?"

**Direct Contact:**
For urgent questions or concerns, contact your healthcare team directly (phone/email) rather than waiting for the next appointment.

#### Readings Not Saving

**Symptoms:** Reading disappears after saving

**Solutions:**

1. Check that you're entering a valid glucose value (typically 20-600 mg/dL or 1.1-33.3 mmol/L)
2. Ensure date/time is not in the future
3. Try restarting the app
4. Check device storage (app needs space to save data)

#### App Crashes or Freezes

**Immediate steps:**

1. Force close the app
2. Reopen the app
3. If crash happens again, restart your device

**If problem persists:**

1. Check for app updates (App Store or Google Play)
2. Update your device's operating system
3. Clear app cache (Android: Settings → Apps → Diabetactic → Storage → Clear Cache)
4. Reinstall the app (data may be lost - sync first if possible)

#### Wrong Glucose Units

**Symptom:** Readings showing in mg/dL when you need mmol/L (or vice versa)

**Solution:**

1. Settings → Glucose Unit
2. Select preferred unit
3. Dashboard and all readings will convert automatically

### Getting Technical Support

**Hospital IT/App Support:**

- Contact information provided in the app (Settings → Help)

## Supporting Your Child

### Age-Appropriate Independence

**Ages 6-8:**

- Parent performs most glucose checks and app entries
- Child watches and learns
- Encourage child to tap "Save Reading" button
- Use kid-friendly view exclusively

**Ages 9-12:**

- Child performs glucose checks with supervision
- Child enters readings in app
- Parent reviews daily
- Gradually introduce parent/technical view
- Discuss patterns in age-appropriate terms

**Ages 13-14:**

- Encourage independence with spot-checks
- Child manages most entries and reminders
- Parent reviews weekly or as needed
- Discuss technical metrics (HbA1c, CV) to build understanding
- Prepare for transition to adult care

### Encouraging Consistent Use

**Make it Routine:**

- Pair app use with existing habits (before meals, bedtime)
- Use reading reminders consistently
- Celebrate streaks ("You recorded all your readings this week!")

**Positive Reinforcement:**

- Focus on effort, not just numbers
- Praise consistency in checking and recording
- Avoid punishing high or low readings

**Gamification (Optional):**

- Create personal challenges ("Can we get 80% time in range this week?")
- Track improvements over time
- Celebrate milestones (100 readings entered, one month of data)

### Emotional Support

**Managing Diabetes Burnout:**

- It's normal for children to feel overwhelmed or frustrated
- Watch for signs: refusing to check glucose, hiding readings, not using the app
- Offer breaks when safe (with healthcare team's guidance)
- Consider professional support (therapist, diabetes counselor)

**Building Confidence:**

- The app's kid-friendly design helps normalize diabetes management
- Encourage notes about feelings, not just physical symptoms
- Recognize and validate the extra work diabetes requires

### Balancing Oversight and Privacy

**For Younger Children:**

- Full access and oversight is appropriate
- Check the app together regularly

**For Adolescents:**

- Respect privacy while maintaining safety
- Discuss expectations clearly (e.g., "I'll check the app weekly, not daily")
- Consider shared access via Tidepool for less intrusive monitoring
- Focus conversations on patterns, not individual readings

- **Time in Range (TIR)**: Percentage of time glucose is within target range (typically 70-180 mg/dL). Goal: 70%+.
- **Coefficient of Variation (CV%)**: Measure of glucose variability. Lower = more stable. Target: <36%.
- **GMI (Glucose Management Indicator)**: Estimate of HbA1c calculated from CGM data.
- **Glucose Target Range**: The range where blood sugar should ideally stay. Usually 70-180 mg/dL (3.9-10.0 mmol/L), but confirm with your healthcare team.
- **Sync**: The process of uploading glucose data from the app to hospital servers or Tidepool.
- **Offline Mode**: The app's ability to function without internet. Data is stored locally and synced when connectivity returns.
