  Network Security Configuration for DEBUG builds only

  This configuration allows cleartext (HTTP) traffic to localhost and the Android
  emulator's special alias (10.0.2.2) which maps to the host machine's localhost.

  SECURITY NOTE: This file is ONLY included in debug builds. Production builds
  will NOT include this configuration and will enforce HTTPS for all connections.

  Android Emulator Network:
  - 10.0.2.2 is a special alias to the host machine's 127.0.0.1
  - This allows the emulator to reach backend services running on the dev machine
