  "description": "the dashboard still doesnt have the two icons that i asked over and over and over. Then why i see server error, thats not nice in an app that is suposed to work offline. │ │ Then what the hell happened here? @/home/julito/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S-124.png was on appointments screen and moved to profile, doesnt happens most of the time. Then the tips screen should be a button under the \"Ver logros\" one, same style, and for the styling inside of the screen check the achievements page for reference the achievements page is a good example of something that is really good looking, there are things to learn there for that and the rest of the app in general. Then add a task to review the dark mode for all the app and screen and modals and such and fix/improve/refactor anything. Then make the Informacion de diabetes and Contacto de emergencia actually usable, they dont seem to be seteable or anything, just a skeleton. Then make the editar edad pop up prettier and fix styling issues and ux.(tall, squared buttons, input age without space on the left and anything to make it better) @/home/julito/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S-125.png Then in settings make Apariencia appear before the Configuracion de glucosa section and Apariencia doesnt have any icon like the other sections does. Then check this section in Profile @/home/julito/Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot_%Y%m%d_%H%M%S-126.png The general text looks misaligend or maybe theres some icon or similar at the left missing/not visible, not sure. Then the info tips in the objetivo and the other open a popup with a label and no text in it, fix that."
