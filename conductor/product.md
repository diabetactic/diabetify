# Initial Concept\nMobile app for diabetes glucose management with offline-first capabilities and Tidepool integration.

\n## Product Vision\nA specialized mobile health platform designed for pediatric Type 1 diabetes management, facilitating high-quality data exchange between patients and clinical teams. The app prioritizes ease of use during consultations and enables modern clinical workflows like virtual appointments.\n\n## Target Users\n- **Primary Users:** Pediatric patients with Type 1 Diabetes and their parents/caregivers.\n- **Primary Beneficiaries:** Endocrinologists and hospital clinical teams who require accurate, ready-to-use data during consultations.\n\n## Core Goals\n- **Clinical Data Readiness:** Ensure glucose readings are synced and ready for review exactly when the consultation starts.\n- **Modern Consultation Workflows:** Facilitate both in-person and virtual appointments within a single ecosystem.\n- **Reliable tracking:** Provide a simple, reliable way for patients to log data regardless of their current connectivity.\n\n## Key Features\n- **Glucose Management:** Robust entry and historical visualization of glucose readings.\n- **Appointment Lifecycle:** Management of clinical appointments, including preparation and execution.\n- **Offline-First Resilience:** Continuous ability to log readings offline, with an automated "catch-up" sync once connectivity is restored. (Note: Appointment management requires an active connection).\n- **Tidepool ID Integration:** Secure authentication link to Tidepool to retrieve and store a unique User ID for cross-reference, without full data synchronization.\n\n## Offline Strategy\n- **Glucose Readings:** Full local storage (Dexie/IndexedDB) with an automated sync queue.\n- **Appointments:** Real-time only; requires active internet connection to ensure synchronization with hospital scheduling systems.
